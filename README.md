# SVM
This project was developed with Jayden Lee to be used for Data Analytics. The Support Vector Machine Learning algorythm uses given CSV provided data that has been pre-processed in order to predict and determine if a client of an insurance company will default. The data given has been cleansed and all attrbiutes have been given generic names thus increasing the difficulty of data prediction as no context was provided.
